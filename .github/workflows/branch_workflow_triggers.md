# Branching Strategy and Workflow Triggers

## üèó Branch Types and Workflow Behaviors

### 1. Main Branch (`main`)
- **Trigger Events**: 
  - Direct pushes
  - Merged pull requests
- **Workflow Actions**:
  - Full test suite
  - Security scanning
  - Deployment to production
  - Automatic release generation

### 2. Development Branch (`develop`)
- **Trigger Events**:
  - Direct pushes
  - Feature branch pull requests
- **Workflow Actions**:
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Integration checks
  - Staging deployment
  - Pre-release validation

### 3. Feature Branches (`feature/*`)
- **Naming Convention**: 
  - `feature/` prefix
  - Descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-template-validation`)
- **Trigger Events**:
  - Pushes to feature branch
  - Pull requests to `develop`
- **Workflow Actions**:
  - Basic validation
  - Subset of test suite
  - Code quality checks
  - Preview deployments

### 4. Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)
- **Naming Convention**:
  - `hotfix/` prefix
  - Specific issue description
- **Trigger Events**:
  - Urgent fixes for production
- **Workflow Actions**:
  - Expedited testing
  - Immediate security scanning
  - Direct path to main branch

### 5. Release Candidate Branches (`rc/*`)
- **Naming Convention**:
  - `rc/` prefix
  - Version number
- **Trigger Events**:
  - Pre-release stabilization
- **Workflow Actions**:
  - Full regression testing
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Final validation before release

## üîç Workflow Trigger Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Development
```
Branch: feature/template-generator-enhancement
Triggers:
- Push to feature branch
- Pull request to develop
Workflow:
- Run unit tests
- Static code analysis
- Generate preview deployment
```

### Scenario 2: Hotfix Implementation
```
Branch: hotfix/security-vulnerability
Triggers:
- Push to hotfix branch
- Immediate pull request to main
Workflow:
- Expedited security scanning
- Critical path testing
- Immediate deployment
```

### Scenario 3: Release Preparation
```
Branch: rc/v1.2.0
Triggers:
- Merge to main
- Release candidate validation
Workflow:
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance testing
- Final security audit
- Automatic release generation
```

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Branch Protection**
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Enforce status checks
   - Limit direct commits to main/develop

2. **Commit Message Conventions**
   - Use semantic commit messages
   - Include issue/ticket references
   - Provide clear, concise descriptions

3. **Workflow Optimization**
   - Cache dependencies
   - Use matrix testing
   - Implement smart caching strategies

## üöÄ Recommended Tools
- GitHub Actions
- Semantic Release
- Conventional Commits
- Branch naming linters

## üîí Security Considerations
- Limit deployment permissions
- Use environment-specific secrets
- Implement branch-level access controls
